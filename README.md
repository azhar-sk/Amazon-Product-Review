# Amazon-Product-Review
It is important to understand the sentiments behind the reviews given by existing customers. Reading each and every review to get an idea of the sentiments of the customer is tedious task. The objective was to create a model which extracts the reviews of a specific product and gives the sentiment value behind every review using sentiment analysis. This project can be used by customers before buying a product and also by the seller to get customer feedback.
