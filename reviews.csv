Sarthak,5.0,A great set of TWS....,"Sound quality is great, calling is great only if using it in a quiet place. Noise cancellation is good. Just the case is pretty big, can't carry it in the pocket. It fits perfectly in the ear and does not get loose or fall. For gamers beast mode is also a great feature in it. Touch sensor on the TWS is 6/10. Overall its a great set of TWS at this pricing one can get with all the features."
Shilpi,5.0,5 üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü,"To be honest, it took some time to explore and adjust the settings. Like 1 side ear phone not working and volume bit on low side. Then took help from manul and end result is amazing. 5 star for bass and sound quality."
Amazon Customer,4.0,Good Deal if buying is under Rs. 1500,"These are my views after testing them for few hours:Pros:Sound quality is good, Nice BASS.Battery backup is good.Bult Quality is good.Easy to operate.Good buy in this price range.Cons:These are not the best looking earbuds, these are in Matte finish but built quality is good.*Do remember to peel the white label on the connectors of earbuds, many people may start thinking that it's a design, the earbuds may not charge or work properly if the white labels are not removed."
mansi,5.0,awesome,best in price range remove the tape for better connect on earbuds
arvind,3.0,Average product. Expected from boat,Sound quality just ok and product quality is not upto the mark. Overall just ok is the product nothing much
Saurabh sharma,4.0,65 ms latency is the best part,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†Product is made in Vietnam.1. Built quality- complete plastic, I must say its good built, but plastic is still plastic, so 8/10You get led sensor on the earbuds and on the case and one rest button, that's the good part2. Sound and bass - Sound and bass is average and 6mm driver3. Mic - mic quality at this price is good, still little disturbance, ""not for outdoor calling""4. Latency-65ms and best part about these earbuds boat airdopes 452, but not for the pros gamer5. Battery life 4 hours and charging time 50 minutes - one more good point6. Ear fitting is not that great so little hard to use for gym and jogging.You can watch full review on youtube channel ""jstech""Thank you for reading"
Onkar Vaidya,4.0,A very good choice for this budget for Wireless Earbuds.,I am a professional Music Producer. So I am very picky about audio devices. But I was surprised with the sound of this one. Not overly sharp. Has a nice frequency response. Clarity is surprising. Bass can be a little better but I am satisfied with it considering the price. The low latency mode is rubbish. It still has considerable audio latency. A good effort by Boat.All ratings below are considering the price range.Bass (Lows) : 8/10Highs :7/10Mids : 8/10Build quality & Comfort : 8/10Overall I would say go for this if you're tight on budget.
Ashwin,1.0,"Worst product, won't recommend.","The sound quality is average. For the connection issue, i tried with 4 different devices and the reachability was pathetic. I had bought a couple of them as a gift and it turned out to be a nightmare.Moreover, Amazon's policy ruined everything. They were like we can replace the product but NOT take a return. Whos does that? Why would someone buy a product online if it's not returnable within the given timeframe, we can visit any offline store, test the product and buy it accordingly. Have escalated the issue to the Amazon's escalation team who will get back yo me within 48 hours."
Arun,1.0,Faulty product,"The right side bud wasn't responsive to touch, tried factory reset and still didn't work. Ordered a replacement which I'm yet to receive. Have to see how it works"
Dhpatel,1.0,Not worth to money,"Sound quality, connectivity to other call r very bad  not good , even very hard attempt to startup, it's case is also significant to put it very carefully inside.. Compare to other..."
Piyush,4.0,Good product best for gaming üî•,Best product at this price bracket. Best for gaming üî•üî• . Sound quality good. Bass decent. Earmuffs use according to your ear size which will give you best noise cancellation. Got it only for 1k during Great Indian sale.
Ritu Rani,1.0,Damaged product delivered,"Got the product in damaged condition today (04-10-2021), I immediately raise the issue for replacement.I like the best thing in Amazon that customer will get the relief for all such type of activities from other vendorsCurrently I can't comment on product quality until I will use the product"
Richa,1.0,"Defective piece received, requested for exchange",Both the earphones are not pairing simultaneously. Tried factory reset but nothing improved. I guess defective product was sent. Asked for replacement immediately on the day of receiving the order.
Aditya,1.0,Defective product received,"I have currently asked Amazon executive to replace it asap, will update review accordingly. As of now, disappointed from boat."
sandeep kothari,4.0,nice one,build and sound quality is really great for this price range..beast mode is also good but in beast mode its delivers left and right sound together means during playing pubg you cant guess that fire from left or right but in normal mode it works fine and latency is also good in normal mode
Vamsi,3.0,Nice product with low latency,Really liked this product with such low latency.  Light weight and build quality is fine. Battery backup is gud.Right bud is not louder as the left bud ordered for replacement. Leaving that right bud issue it is a best product for that price.

Harikrishna Varma,2.0,Misleading colour,The blue colour shown in the picture is misleading as the actual colour is way lighter; kind of a cheap blue than sporty blue
